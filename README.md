# Student Success Prediction
 Using data from the UCI repository to predict student success

Dataset Description: This dataset examines student achievement in secondary education at two Portuguese schools. It includes attributes related to student grades (for a high school Portugese class), demographic, social, and school-related features, collected through school reports and questionnaires.

In the study by Cortez and Silva (2008), the datasets were modeled using binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. The study can be found here https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/8024/1/student.pdf
